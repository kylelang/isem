## At-Home Exercises

This week is all about gaining familiarity with R and RStudio. We'll be using material from the introductory tutorials
that were previously available as *Posit Primers*. These exercises work through some basic elements of data
visualization and statistical programming in R. Although you should already have R working, this week's practical
exercises don't require that you have R installed on your system.

You can access the At-Home Exercises via the following links.
