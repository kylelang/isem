## At-Home Exercises

This week is all about gaining familiarity with R and RStudio. We'll be using material from the introductory tutorials
available at <https://www.openstatprog.com>. These exercises work through the basics of R usage and data types. Although
you should already have R working, this week's practical exercises don't require that you have R installed since you'll
be able to complete the R practice problems in your web browser.

You can access the two parts of the At-Home Exercises via the following links.
