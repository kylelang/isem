## Reading

There is no official reading this week. 

- If you'd like to deepen your dive into R, feel free to check out Hadley 
  Wickham's excellent book [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).
- Otherwise, you may want to get a jump-start on the
  [At-Home Exercises](at-home-exercises.html) for this week.
