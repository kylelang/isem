## Rules {-}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Resources {-}

For both assignments, you may use any reference materials you like, including:

- All course materials
- The course GitBook
- Additional books and papers
- The internet

### Collaboration {-}

You will complete the first assignment in groups.

- Although you will work in groups, your group may not work together with other groups.

You will complete the final assignment individually. 

- For this assignment, you may not work with anyone else.

For both assignments, you are obligated to submit original work (i.e., work conducted for this course by you or your
group). 

- Submitting an assignment that violates this condition constitutes fraud.
- Such cases of fraud will be addressed according to the 
[University's standard policy](https://students.uu.nl/en/practical-information/policies-and-procedures/fraud-and-plagiarism).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Academic integrity {-}

Hopefully, you also feel a moral obligation to obey the rules. For this course, we have implemented an examination that
allows you to showcase what you have learned in a more realistic way than a written exam would allow. 

- This assessment format spares you the stress of long exams (the two exams for this course used to be 4 hours each) and
the attendant studying/cramming. 
- The assignments will also help you assess your ability to independently analyse data, which is important to know for
your future courses and/or career.

However, this format also assumes that you complete the assignments in good faith. So, I simply ask that you hold up
your end of the bargain, and submit your original work to show us what you’ve learned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### GenAI disclosure statement {-}

Naturally, all of the [course policies on GenAI](#ai_policy) also apply to the data analysis assignments. In addition to
these general policies, you must include a GenAI disclosure statement in each of your assignments.

You are free to use AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or GitHub CoPilot, but you must cite the tools you used in the same
way that you would cite any other software. As with citing any other source, properly citing AI tools both attributes
the appropriate credit to the tool’s developers and helps you clearly and accurately describe your own work. In addition
to providing a valid citation, you must also explain how you used the AI tool. Specifically, did you use AI to:

1. Create new content (e.g., use ChatGPT to draft some parts of the text)
1. Modify content that you created (e.g., use CoPilot to debug your R code)

Provide this information in a separate *GenAI Disclosure Statement* section at the end of your report.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Strict stuff {-}

By submitting your assignments (both group and individual), you confirm the following:

1. You have completed the assignment yourself (or with your group)
1. You are submitting work that you have written yourself (or with your group)
1. You are using your own UU credentials to submit the assignment
1. You have not had outside help that violates the conditions delineated above while completing the assignment

All assignments will be submitted via Ouriginal in Blackboard and, thereby, checked for plagiarism. If fraud or
plagiarism is detected or suspected, we will inform the Board of Examiners in the usual manner. In the event of
demonstrable fraud, the sanctions delineated in Article 5.15 of the
[Education and Examination Regulations (EER)](https://students.uu.nl/en/fss/education-and-examination-regulations-eer)
will apply.
