## Formative Assessment

A formative assessment helps you judge your progress in the course and helps you 
address any blind spots in your understanding of the material. 

- This assessment does not contribute to your course grade.
- If you get a question wrong, you will receive a hint on how to improve your 
understanding of the material.

Ideally, you should complete this assessment  *after* you have watched the 
lecture recording, but *before* the lecture meeting. 

- This way, if you discover gaps in your understanding, we can discuss any 
topics that need more attention during the lecture meeting.
