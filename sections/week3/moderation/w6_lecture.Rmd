As with mediation, researchers often posit theories involving moderation. 
Moderation implies that the effect of X on Y depends on another variable, Z. For 
instance, the effect of feedback (X) on performance (Y) may depend on age (Z). 
Older children might process feedback more effectively than younger children. 
Hence, the feedback is more effective for older children than for younger 
children, and the effect of feedback on performance is stronger for older 
children than for younger children. In such a case, we would say that age 
*moderates* the effect of feedback on performance.
