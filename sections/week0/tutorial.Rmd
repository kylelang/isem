# R Tutorial {-}

Welcome to the world of R! This chapter provides a tutorial based on "R: How to 
get started" by [Ihnwhi Heo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ihnwhi-heo/), 
[Duco Veen](https://www.ducoveen.com/), and 
[Rens van de Schoot](https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/).

- If you already have a good deal of R experience, and you don't see anything new in this tutorial, feel free to skip this chapter.
- If you haven't worked with R before, I strongly encourage you to spend some time 
carefully working through this tutorial. The content of this chapter will go a 
long way towards familiarizing you with the basic R commands that you will need 
to use at the beginning of the course.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Who R you?

R is a piece of free software for statistical computation and graphics. R is 
also fully open-source, which means anyone (even you!) can improve, develop, and 
contribute to R

-	You can find the official manual from the R Core Team here: 
[An introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf)

R itself looks a bit old-fashioned and tedious:

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## RStudio

Thankfully, we have a great user interface for R called RStudio!

-	RStudio helps you use and learn R more easily.
-	Although you are interacting with RStudio, you are still using R.
    - Don't ever write something like, "We conducted all analysis with RStudio..."
-	For this course, all tutorials and practicals will use  RStudio.

### No ‘pane’, no gain!

When you open RStudio, the screen should look something like the following image. 
You will notice that the window is divided into ‘panes’ (a pane is a division of 
a window).

![](images/tut_panes.jpg)

Before we explain these three panes, I want you to add another, which you will 
see if you open an R script. An R script is simply a plain-text file wherein you
will write the R code that executes your analyses. When you open an R script (or 
create a new one, which is really the same thing), a fourth pane appears.

---

### Create a new R script

To create a new R script, Click the icon with a plus sign on the paper 
(highlighted below by the red square).

![](images/tut_new_file.png)


When you click this icon, a new script is generated and appears in a fourth pane 
on the upper left side of the screen (if you're using the default layout).

- Note that this script is not yet saved anywhere. If you close this script 
without saving, you will lose all its  contents.

![](images/tut_panes2.jpg)

The four panes help organize your workflow. Rstudio is an *integrated development 
environment* (IDE) that is meant to integrate all of the tasks you may need to 
do for any R-based analysis, programming, or development. Hence, in RStudio, the 
intended workflow will have you do everything in one window, and the four panes 
make this workflow more efficient (in theory, at least).

---

### What do the four panes do?

Note that the following descriptions apply to the default layout. You can change 
the orientation and content of the panes (although you must always have four).

-	*Source Pane*: Located in the top left quadrant. 
    - This pane is also called the "Editor", because this is where we edit scripts. 
    - We will usually type our code in the source pane.
-	*Console Pane*: Located in the bottom left quadrant. 
    - This pane is for direct communication with R. 
    - We can type commands here that are *immediately* evaluated (whereas the
    commands in a script are only evaluated when we explicitly run them). 
    - Furthermore, all output from the R commands that we run (either via the 
    console or a script) is printed in the console pane.

The two panes on the right side of the window contain various tabs. Two of these 
tabs are especially useful.

- *Environment Tab*: Located in the upper right quadrant 
    - The environment tab contains all the ‘objects’ currently loaded in your 
      R session. 
    - You can always check what objects are loaded under the environment tab. 
    - The 'environment' is also called the 'workspace'
- *Plots Tab*: Located in the lower right quadrant
    - The plots tab shows any graphs and figures we draw via R commands. 
    - If you zoom by clicking the magnifying glass icon, you can see enlarged 
      versions of the plots.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## RStudio projects

To keep all your work organized, you can use an **RStudio Project**.

One advantage of using RStudio projects is that the project directory is 
automatically set as the working directory. 

- If you save your data in the directory that contains the *".Rproj"* file, you 
will can load the data without specifying the file path.

---

### Starting a new project in Rstudio
 
In Rstudio, click on the *New project* button:

![](images/tut_new_proj.png)

1. In the pop-up dialog, click *New Directory*.
1. Click *New Project*.
1. Type the desired directory name in the dialog box 
   - Give a meaningful name, e.g., "TCSM_Course".
   - Use the *Browse* button if you need to change the location of the directory 
   that you will use to store this project. 

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Loading data

Statistical analysis cannot happen without data. In R, you can load data in 
various ways. Let’s go over a couple of these.

- To complete the following exercise, first download the [`LifeSat.sav` data][LifeSat].

---

### Via clicky-box options

1. Click through the following menu options: *File* > *Import Dataset*
1. Choose the type of dataset. 
   - For this exercise, the data are stored as an SPSS .sav file. 
   - Thus, select the *From SPSS* option.

You may encounter an *Install Required Packages* pop-up dialog with a message 
that asks you whether you want to install the `haven` package. 

<center>
![](images/tut_packages.jpg)
</center>

A package is an a piece of add-on software for R.

- To do most analyses, you will need some packages above-and-beyond the Base R 
software.
- In this case, `haven` contains functions that allow R to read SPSS data files.
-	Click ‘Yes’ to install the package.

At this point, the *Import Statistical Data* pop-up dialog should appear.

1. Provide the location of your data file in the *File/URL* field.
   - You can type the file path directly.
   - You can also click *Browse* to find the file via a GUI interface.
   
You should now see your data in the *Data Preview* area.

-	In the *Import Options* section, you can set the name and format of your data 
file.

All of your your selections are being translated to the R-code required to load 
your file. 

- In the *Code Preview* area, the steps required to load the data with your 
selected options are expressed in terms of code.

Finally, click *Import* at the lower right side of the window to load your data.

![](images/tut_load_data.gif)

---

### Via R code

Of course, we don't have to use tedious clicky-box processes. Once you get more 
familiar with R, it will be much easier to load data with R code.

-	For this exercise, we will use the `read.spss()` function from the `foreign` 
package.

Copy the following code into an R-script.

- Note that this code assumes you have saved your data in the *working directory* 
(this is the project directory if you're using an R project).
- Otherwise, you will need to specify the file path to your data file as the 
first argument.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(foreign)

LifeSat <- read.spss(paste0(dataDir, "LifeSat.sav"), 
                     to.data.frame = TRUE, 
                     use.value.labels = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(foreign)

LifeSat <- read.spss("LifeSat.sav", 
                     to.data.frame    = TRUE, 
                     use.value.labels = FALSE)
```

To run the code:

1. Place your cursor on the first line of code.
1. Press the *Ctrl/Cmd* + *Enter* keys together.

The code should now be evaluated by R, and R will tell you the result of its 
actions in the console pane.

---

#### Data frames

When we read data into R, the data are most often stored as a special type of 
object called a *data frame*. 

- Data frames are the preferred way to handle data in R.
- Data frames can hold variables with different types (e.g., a numeric 
depression rating, a categorical grouping factor representing employment status, 
and a character string recording the response to an open-ended question).
- The option `to.data.frame = TRUE` in the `read.spss()` call above loads the
data into a data frame.

---

### From Excel files

We can also load data that are stored in Excel files. One way to do so is via 
the `readxl` package. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Load the package:
library(readxl)

## Read the first sheet of 'LifeSat.xlsx' into 'LifeSat':
LifeSat <- read_excel("LifeSat.xlsx", sheet = 1)
```

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Exploring data via R functions

If you look a bit more closely at the R code that we used to load the data, 
you will see two special commands: `library()` and `read.spss()`. 

- These commands are called *functions*.
   - Any R command that is written as a name followed by parentheses, e.g., 
   `mean()`, is a function.
- Functions are the driving force behind all R-based data analysis.
   - Functions tell R to perform a specific (potentially very complicated) task.
   - Rather than having to write out along sequence of commands every time we 
   want to do some task, we can simply call the appropriate function.
   
When using functions, you need to provide appropriate inputs to specify the 
behavior of the function and give the function data on which to operate. 

- These inputs are called *function arguments*. 

Let’s explore three new functions and their arguments. These functions can help 
us understand our data.

---

### `head()`

Our data comprise many rows. We can use the `head()` function to inspect the 
first several rows.

-	To use the `head()` function, you only need to provide one argument: The name 
of the dataset.

```{r}
## Inspect the first several rows
head(LifeSat)
```

“Wait, what is the hash tag (#) doing there?” 

- Don’t be surprised. The hash tag creates a "comment". I.e., a bit of text that 
will not be evaluated by R. 
   - Comments let us write notes to explain what a particular piece of code does. 
   - Comments are doubly useful.
       - They can help others understand your code.
       - They can also help you remember what the code does after some time away.
	
Copy the preceding code into your R script and run it. 

- If all went well, R should now show the first six rows of the dataset in the 
console.

---

### `str()` {#str}

We frequently want to know something about the types of variables in a dataset. 

- For example, if you want to run an analysis of variance (ANOVA), the 
independent variable(s) should be categorical.
   - In R, these variables would be represented by a special type of variable 
   called a *factor*.
   - Before running our analysis, we should check if are data satisfy this 
   requirement.

We can use the `str()` function to get some information about the structure of 
an R object (*str* is an abbreviation of *structure*). 

- To run the `str()` function, you only need to provide one argument: the name 
of the dataset.

```{r}
## Inspect the structure of the dataset
str(LifeSat)
```

According to the output printed to the console, the `LifeSat` dataset is a data
frame consisting of `r nrow(LifeSat)` observations of `r ncol(LifeSat)` variables. 

- I.e., our dataset has `r nrow(LifeSat)` rows and `r ncol(LifeSat)` columns.

We also get information about the contents of each column.

-	For the fist column, we see `$ LifSat  : num  13 18 19 24 24 24 30 33 33 33 ...` 
    - The `LifSat` variable is numeric (abbreviated as *num*).
    - `r LifeSat$LifSat[1]` is the value in the first row, 
    `r LifeSat$LifSat[2]` is the value in the second row, 
    `r LifeSat$LifSat[3]` is the value in the third row, and so on.

---

### `summary()`

We can get the descriptive statistics of the variables in a dataset with the 
`summary()` function. 

- Again, we only need to provide one argument: the name of the dataset. 

```{r}
summary(LifeSat)
```

Run the above code and check the output in the console. 

- You should see descriptive statistics for each variable in the dataset. 
- E.g., for `LifSat`, the minimum value is `r min(LifeSat$LifSat) %>% round(2)`, 
the median is `r median(LifeSat$LifSat) %>% round(2)`, and the mean is 
`r mean(LifeSat$LifSat) %>% round(2)`.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Plotting data {#tutorialPlotting}

It is almost always a good idea to visualize your data before you dive into a 
full statistical analysis. For example, you may like to know something about the 
nature of the relationship between two specific variables, the distribution of 
some set of values, etc.

- In this section, we will create three basic plots of our data. 
- When we create these plots, the figures will appear in the plots tab in the 
lower right quadrant of the RStudio window.

---

### R packages and `ggplot2`

We will use the `ggplot2` package for plotting. This package is not part of the 
Base R installation. So, you must install `ggplot2` yourself (you should have 
already done so in Section \@ref(installPackages)).

- You only need to install an R package once.
    - R packages are just small software programs, so they must be installed 
    just like any other piece of software.
    - After installing, the package is accessible on your computer but not yet 
    available for use in your current R session.
        - You must first load the package.
- You need to load the package every time you want to use it in a new R session.
    - After loading, the package contents (i.e., functions, help files, datasets)
    are initialized in memory and ready to use in your current R session.
    - Loading a package is more-or-less equivalent to 'opening' a software 
    program by clicking on its desktop icon.

Run the following code to load the `ggplot2` package.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

---

### Histogram

We can use a histogram to visualize how the values of a continuous variable are 
distributed.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
## Use the 'LifeSat' data to create the plot
## Use the 'LifeSat$LifSat' variable to define the X-axis
ggplot(data = LifeSat, aes(x = LifSat)) +
  geom_histogram() # Create a histogram from the data/variable defined above
```

---

### Boxplot

A boxplot provides another useful visualization of a continuous variable's
distribution. We can also use boxplots to detect outliers.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
## Same data/variable setup as above:
ggplot(data = LifeSat, aes(x = LifSat)) +
  geom_boxplot() # Create a boxplot
```

---

### Scatterplot

A scatterplot provides a visual representation of the relationship between two 
variables. 

- Since we are now plotting two variables, we need to define a `y` variable in 
addition to the`x` variable specified in the previous examples.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
## Add the 'age' variable on the Y-axis:
ggplot(data = LifeSat, aes(x = LifSat, y = age)) +
  geom_point() # Create a scatterplot
```

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Manipulating Data

---

### Data types

Recall the output of the `str()` function. One piece of information contained 
therein is the type of data stored in each column of our dataset. 

- There a different abbreviations signifying different types of data.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(
  Abbreviation = c("num", "chr", "log", "factor"),
  Type = c("Numeric", "Character", "Logical", "Factor"),
  Description = c("All values are numbers (e.g., 1.02)",
                  "All values are words",
                  "Boolean flags: TRUE or FALSE",
                  "A special type of object with labels to represent the levels of a categorical variable")
) %>% knitr::kable()
```

---

### Factors

Factors are a special type of data object that R uses to represent categorical 
variables.

- A factor is stored internally as a vector of integers where each group is 
represented by a different number.
- The groups also get descriptive labels.
- R knows that a factor is not numeric and will treat any factor as a nominal 
grouping variable for anlaysis.

In the output from the `str()` function in \@ref(str), we see that the `gender` 
variable is stored as a numeric variable.

- You can confirm by running either of the following commands.

```{r}
is.numeric(LifeSat$gender)
class(LifeSat$gender)
```

The `gender` variable is a binary grouping variable, so it should be stored as a 
factor.

- To convert `gender` to a factor, we can use the `factor()` function.

```{r}
## Convert 'gender' to a factor:
LifeSat$gender <- factor(LifeSat$gender)

## Check the results:
is.numeric(LifeSat$gender)
class(LifeSat$gender)
str(LifeSat$gender)
```

We now see that `gender` has been converted to a factor with the levels "1" and
"2". We don't have to settle for meaningless numeric labels, though.

- We can assign meaningful value labels by providing an appropriate input for 
the `labels` argument.

```{r}
## Create a factor with meaningful labels:
LifeSat$gender <- factor(LifeSat$gender, labels = c("Female", "Male"))

## Check the results:
str(LifeSat$gender)
```

---

### Subsetting: Extracting one variable

When working with data frames, we can extract a single variable (i.e., column) 
from the data using the dollar sign operator, `$`. As shown in the example below.

```{r}
# Extract the 'LifSat' variable from 'LifeSat':
LifeSat$LifSat
```

In the above code, we ask R to extract the column named `LifSat` from the data 
frame named `LifeSat`.

- The result will be returned as another special type of object: a *vector*.

---

### Subsetting: Extracting rows and columns

We can also extract rectangular subsets of a data frame using the following 
convention: `my_data_frame[row_numbers, column_numbers]`. 

```{r}
## Extract the first four rows of the first two columns:
LifeSat[1:4, 1:2]
```

By leaving either rows or columns empty, we get all rows or columns:

```{r}
## Extract all rows of first two columns:
LifeSat[ , 1:2]
```


```{r}
## Extract all columns of first two rows:
LifeSat[1:2, ]
```

We can refer to the columns by name, too:

```{r}
LifeSat[1:2, c("age", "educ")]
```

---

### Subsetting based on logical conditions {#logicalSubsetting}

We can also select rows or columns that satisfy logical conditions.

- In the following code, we select only the rows for which `LifeSat$age` is 
greater than 70.

```{r}
LifeSat[LifeSat$age > 70, ]
```

This approach works for any valid logical expression that will flag rows (or 
columns).

- Below, we select only the males and save the subset as a new object, 
`LifeSat_male`.

```{r}
LifeSat_male <- LifeSat[LifeSat$gender == "Male", ]
str(LifeSat_male)
```

---

### Changing cell values

We can easily overwrite values in a dataset using the same type of subsetting 
operations shown above in combination with the assignment operator, `<-`.

- The following code will extract the 5*th* entry in the `LifSat` variable.

```{r}
LifeSat[5, "LifSat"]
```

Actually, it's not really accurate to say that the above code "extracts" any value.

- The above command creates a new temporary object containing only the relevant 
value and prints the contents of that object to the console.
- All the subsetting examples above (other than the selection of all males) have 
done something similar.

Rather than thinking about the `[]` or `$` selection operators as ways of 
extracting pieces of a data object, it's more appropriate to think about these 
operators as selecting, highlight, activating, nominating (or some other such 
concept) the referenced elements.

- Once the elements are so selected, we can also overwrite their original values.
- We only need to assign new values to the subset.

To demonstrate, let's overwrite the value selected above with `10`.

```{r}
## Overwrite the 5th 'LifSat' value:
LifeSat[5, "LifSat"] <- 10

## Check the result:
LifeSat[5, "LifSat"]
```

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Getting Help

As you start to apply the techniques described in this guide, you will soon have
questions that the guide does not answer. This section describes a few tips on 
how to get help answering these questions.

1. Every function in R has documentation (i.e., a help file). To see this file 
in RStudio, select the name of the function in your script, and press F1, or run 
the command `?` followed by the name of the function (e.g., `?aov`).
    - The second option works outside of RStudio, too.
1. If you get stuck, start with **Google**. 
    - Typically, adding “R” to a search is enough to return relevant results (e.g., 
    "exploratory factor analysis R"). 
    - Google is particularly useful for error messages. If you get an error 
    message that you don't understand, try googling it. Someone else has almost
    certainly been confused by the same message in the past, and there will be 
    help somewhere on the web. 
    - If the error message isn’t in English, run `Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "en")` 
    and re-run the code that produced the error (you’re more likely to find help 
    for English error messages.)
1. If Google doesn’t help, try [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). 
    - Before posting your question, spend some time searching the site for an 
    existing answer (active contributors really hate it when you ask a question 
    that has already been answered on the site).
    - Including \[R] in your search string restricts your search to questions 
    and answers that use R.
1. Lastly, if you find errors (or typos!) in this guide's text or R syntax, feel 
free to contact me ([Kyle Lang](mailto:k.m.lang@uu.nl)).
