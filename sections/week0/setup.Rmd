# Software Setup {-}

This chapter will help you prepare for the course by showing how to install R and RStudio on your computer. If you're
already using R, there may be nothing new for you here. That being said, you should look over this chapter to ensure
that your current setup will be compatible with the course requirements.

If you have never used R before, this chapter is essential! The information is this chapter will be crucial for getting
your computer ready for the course.

## Typographic Conventions {-}

Throughout this GitBook, we (try to) use a consistent set of typographic conventions:

- Functions are typeset in a code font, and the name of the function is always followed by parentheses.
    - E.g., `sum()`, `mean()`
- Other R objects (e.g., data objects, function arguments) are in also typeset in a code font but without parentheses.
    - E.g., `seTE`, `method.tau`
- Sometimes, weâ€™ll use the package name followed by two colons (`::`, the so-called *scope-resolution operator), like
  `lavaan::sem()`. This command is valid R code and will run if you copy it into your R console. The `lavaan::` part of
  the command tells R that we want to use the `sem()` from the `lavaan` package.

## Installing software {-}

Before we start the course, we have to install two crucial pieces of software:

- **R**: A free program for statistical programming
- **RStudio**: An integrated development environment (IDE) which makes it easier 
to work with R. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Installing R {-}

The latest version of R is available [here](https://cran.r-project.org).

- Click the appropriate link for your operating system and follow the instructions for installing the latest stable
release.
- Depending on which OS you select, you may be given an option to install 
different components (e.g., *base*, *contrib*, *Rtools*).
   - For this course, you will only need the *base* package. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Installing RStudio {-}

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG(here::here("assets", "images", "rstudiologo.png"))
grid.raster(img)
```

Download the Free Desktop version of RStudio from the [download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
of the [Posit website](https://www.posit.co/).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Installing packages {-}

To participate in this course, you will need to install several additional **R packages**. For example, we'll make
extensive use of the three packages described in the following table.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(
  Package = c(
    "lavaan",
    "dplyr",
    "ggplot2"
  ),
  Description = c(
    "A sophisticated and user-friendly package for structural equation modeling",
    "A powerful suite of data-processing tools",
    "A flexible and user-friendly package for making graphs"
  )
) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

For the most part, you'll install new packages when necessary as part of the weekly practical exercises. But, you might
as well get a head start by installng **lavaan**, **dplyr**, and **ggplot2** now. You don't need any fancy tools to
install new packages, we simply call the `install.packages()` function in R.

1. Open RStudio
1. Inside RStudio, find the window named **Console** on left side of the screen.
1. Copy the following code into the console and hit `Enter`/`Return` to run the command.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("lavaan", "dplyr", "ggplot2"), dependencies = TRUE)
```

#### Compiling packages from source {-}

On Windows and Mac, R packages are distributed in two ways:

1. Pre-compiled binary executables
   - Binary packages can be run directly (equivalent to .exe files on Windows).
   - You don't need any special tools to install binary packages.
1. Archives of source code
   - Packages installed via source code must be compiled locally.
   - You will need an appropriate toolchain to build and install the package.
   - New versions of a package are usually distributed via source code before they get a binary release. So this option
   will get you the latest versions of the packages.

When you run the above command, you may see a message asking if you would like to compile certain packages from source.
If so, it's usually best to accept this option. You may also get a message asking if you want to install **Rtools**. A
typical Windows setup is missing the toolchain needed to compile R packages from source, so the R folks have packaged
the necessary tools in a standalone software bundle called **Rtools**.

You can find the appropriate **Rtools** installer through
[this CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

- Follow the links for your R version and operating system.
